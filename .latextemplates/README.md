# L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X Templates I Love

This is where I keep L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X (and Ti*k*Z) templates from The Comprehensive 
T<sub>E</sub>X 
Archive 
(i.e. [CTAN](https://ctan.org)), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), 
[ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates), GitHub, and ones I 
create myself.

I try to document within the folder where it came from, or if it's from GitHub I upload it as a git 
submodule.

#### Good links
